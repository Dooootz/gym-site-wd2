      <h3>Our philosiphy</h3>
      <p>
        We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City,
        Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.
      </p>
      <p>
        ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with
        gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength
        believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health
        is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight
        loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more
        energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group
        fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight
        loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les
        Mills accredited instructors and are second to none – all have
        Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest
        of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying
        telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for
        themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of
        mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine
        dreams up.  You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at
        your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health
        club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride
        ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation,
        no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit
        rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that
        passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old
        school feel with a new school attitude!
      </p>
      <p>
        We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays,
        weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7
        gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a
        protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for
        you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site
        for the timetable at each of our clubs.
